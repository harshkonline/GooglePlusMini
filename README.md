# GooglePlusMini

Android GooglePlusMini:  
Implemented an android application called GooglePlusMini which authenticates user against Google Plus API through 
Oauth2 authorization and allows a user to login with a Google Account (with Google Plus enabled) 
to view his/her profile, circles, and friends by integrating with the Google Plus (G+) APIs.
